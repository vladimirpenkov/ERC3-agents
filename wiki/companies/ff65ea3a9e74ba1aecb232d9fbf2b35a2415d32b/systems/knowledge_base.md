# Knowledge Base / Wiki

The **knowledge base** (this wiki) is the central place for **processes, guidelines, technical notes and reference information** at Bellini Coatings.

## Purpose

- Preserve and share **know‑how** across locations and generations.
- Provide clear **process descriptions** for onboarding and daily work.
- Document **approved solutions**, best practices and lessons learned.
- Serve as a key source of context for the **chatbot**.

## Content types

Typical content includes:

- Company information (history, mission, organisation).
- Market and customer insights.
- R&D guidelines, test methods and application notes.
- Production and quality procedures (at a conceptual level; detailed SOPs may be separate).
- System usage guides and tips.
- HR and people‑related information (skills & wills, roles, development programmes).

## Structure

Pages are organised in logical folders, for example:

- `company/` – About Bellini as a company.
- `business/` – Markets, customers, marketing and sales approach.
- `operations/` – Factories, production and logistics concepts.
- `hr/` – People, departments, skills and example profiles.
- `systems/` – Systems overview and usage guidelines.

This structure is reflected in file paths (e.g. `systems/project_registry.md`).

## Editing and ownership

- Each section of the wiki has **content owners** (e.g. HR for HR pages, IT for systems pages, R&D for technical guidelines).
- Updates are coordinated via these owners to ensure consistency (top execs have full control).
- To delete a page - zero out its content. To rename - transfer content to new location and zero out old page.
- The IT & Digital team maintains the **technical infrastructure** and integrates the wiki with the chatbot.

## Relation to other systems

- The wiki is **not** a replacement for transactional data (e.g. CRM entries, project records, time logs).
- Instead, it documents:
  - How to use systems.
  - Why certain processes exist.
  - What standards and best practices apply.

The chatbot can search the wiki to answer “how” and “why” questions, and it can link directly to articles when relevant.

## Good practices

- Keep pages **short, focused and up to date**.
- Use clear headings and bullet points.
- Add **links** to related pages and systems where helpful.
- Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.
