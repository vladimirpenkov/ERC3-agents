# Factories & Production

Bellini Coatings operates two main production sites: **Italy** (HQ) and **Serbia**. Together they provide flexibility, redundancy and access to different markets.

## Italian factory

### Role

The Italian factory is the **original and flagship site**. It focuses on:

- High‑value, complex and customised formulations.
- Smaller batch sizes with more frequent changeovers.
- Production of critical intermediates and components for some systems.
- Pilot and pre‑series batches for new developments.

### Organisation

- **Plant Manager Italy**
  - Production supervisors (multiple shifts)
  - Maintenance
  - Local warehouse team

- **On‑site support functions**
  - R&D labs (co‑located but reporting to R&D Director)
  - QA laboratory (reports to Quality & HSE)
  - Scheduling and planning (reports to Logistics & Supply Chain)

### Key characteristics

- High mix of products and colours; strong emphasis on **changeover discipline**.
- Frequent interaction between **production, R&D and application specialists**.
- Time‑critical orders for key accounts with strict delivery windows.

## Serbian factory

### Role

The Serbian factory primarily handles:

- Standard and mid‑complexity formulations.
- Larger batch sizes and more stable demand products.
- Regional orders for Central & Eastern Europe, often with shorter lead times.

### Organisation

- **Plant Manager Serbia**
  - Production supervisors (shift‑based)
  - Local QA technicians
  - Warehouse and loading team

Serbian production follows the same **recipes, specifications and quality standards** as the Italian plant. Many formulations are transferred from Italy after validation.

### Key characteristics

- Younger workforce, more open to adopting new tools and process improvements.
- Strong focus on **efficiency and cost competitiveness**.
- Coordination with HQ on planning, quality issues and technical changes.

## Production and systems

Both plants rely on the central Progress‑based systems for:

- **Production orders and recipes** (derived from project outcomes and product master data).
- **Time logging** for supervisors and selected roles (especially for support, rework and improvement projects).
- **Non‑conformity and deviation tracking** (often supplemented with Excel and paper forms).

Production supervisors are encouraged to:

- Ensure all improvement or troubleshooting efforts are linked to **projects** (internal or customer) where appropriate.
- Log their own time to give visibility into the effort required for support activities.
- Use the internal wiki to access **application notes** and **standard operating procedures** for production.
