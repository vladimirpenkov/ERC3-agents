# Marketing & Sales Approach

Bellini Coatings uses a **relationship‑driven, technically supported B2B sales model**. We focus on medium and large industrial customers where coatings are critical to their operations and product quality.

## Positioning

We present ourselves as:

- A **specialist**, not a generalist commodity supplier.
- A **partner** that co‑develops solutions with customers.
- A company that combines **Italian coating heritage** with pragmatic engineering.

Our value proposition is often expressed as:
> “Tailored industrial coatings backed by experts who know your application.”

## Marketing channels

Marketing is modest in size but focused:

- **Trade fairs and industry events**
  - Key touchpoint for new leads.
  - Often coordinated by marketing, attended by sales and technical experts.

- **Technical datasheets and case studies**
  - Maintained jointly by marketing and R&D.
  - Linked from the internal wiki and shared via customer portals or email.

- **Targeted outreach**
  - Regional sales teams focus on clusters (e.g. machinery in southern Germany, rail around major hubs).
  - Outreach is mostly via email, phone and site visits.

- **Digital presence**
  - Corporate website and selected online directories.
  - Limited paid campaigns; emphasis on credibility rather than volume.

## Sales process

The sales process is structured but implemented in a **very hands‑on, old‑school way**:

1. **Initial contact**
   - Lead identified via fair, referral or inbound request.
   - Customer added to CRM; a short **brief** is recorded.

2. **Qualification**
   - Account manager visits the site, sometimes with a technical sales engineer.
   - Feasibility is evaluated: volumes, application method, regulatory constraints.

3. **Project creation**
   - A **project** is created in the project registry for any substantial opportunity.
   - The project links the customer, the brief and the internal team (sales, R&D, application specialists).

4. **Trials and testing**
   - Lab work is performed by chemists.
   - Field tests may be run on customer lines.
   - Time spent is logged against the project.

5. **Offer & negotiation**
   - Pricing, volume commitments and service levels are negotiated.
   - CRM and project registry track phase changes and expected volumes.

6. **Implementation & support**
   - If successful, the project transitions into an ongoing supply and support phase.
   - Technical service, quality and logistics remain involved.

## Sales organisation

- **Head of Sales & Marketing**
  - Responsible for overall sales strategy and key account management.

  - Manage account managers and coordinate with technical sales.

## CRM usage principles

Even though our CRM and project systems are built on **legacy technology**, they are the **single source of truth** for:

- Customer master data.
- Key contacts and roles.
- Active and recent projects.
- High‑level status of opportunities.

Account managers are expected to keep **deal phases** and **briefs** reasonably up to date, and to link projects correctly to customers. This is essential for meaningful reports and for the chatbot to give accurate answers.
