# Company History

Bellini Coatings has grown from a small family workshop into a specialised European coatings manufacturer over the course of a century.

## 1925–1950: Founding years

- **1925 – Foundation.** Carlo Bellini, a chemist with a passion for colours, starts a small paint workshop in northern Italy. Early customers are local metal workshops, carpenters and agricultural equipment makers.
- **1930s – First industrial customers.** The company begins supplying coatings to regional machine builders. Production is manual and highly craft-based.
- **1940s – War and reconstruction.** Operations are disrupted during WWII. Post‑war reconstruction creates strong demand for paints and coatings, and Bellini rebuilds and expands its facility.

## 1950–1980: Industrialisation and export

- **1950s – New factory.** A more modern plant is built on the outskirts of the town, with larger batch mixers and better quality control.
- **1960s – First exports.** Bellini begins supplying customers in Switzerland and Germany, primarily in machinery and automotive components.
- **1970s – Technical specialisation.** The company invests in a small R&D lab, moving from generic paints to **application‑specific coatings**, especially for anti‑corrosion and high‑temperature uses.

## 1980–2000: Systems, quality and the Bellini brand

- **1980s – Quality systems.** Formal QA and HSE practices are introduced. The “Bellini Coatings” brand is established for export markets.
- **Early 1990s – IT era.** The company implements its first integrated business systems, built on **Progress OpenEdge**. These systems (CRM, project registry, time tracking, employee registry) form the backbone still in use today.
- **Late 1990s – EU expansion.** Sales offices are opened in Germany and France to support growing OEM customers.

## 2000–2015: International footprint and the Serbian plant

- **2000s – Growth with key accounts.** Bellini secures several long‑term supply contracts in rail, food & beverage, and industrial equipment.
- **2008–2010 – Serbia plant.** To remain competitive and increase capacity, a new production facility is opened in northern Serbia. Standard and mid‑complexity products are gradually transferred there.
- **2010s – Professionalisation.** Non‑family executives join the leadership team in finance, operations and IT. Processes become more standardised, though the family maintains clear strategic control.

## 2015–Today: Digitalisation and the chatbot era

- **2015–2020 – Incremental modernisation.** Reporting and some workflows are improved, but the core Progress systems remain largely unchanged. Employees become increasingly reliant on spreadsheets and email alongside the mainframe.
- **2020–2023 – New generation.** Giulia Bellini, representing the 4th generation, becomes CEO. She pushes for better use of data and a more structured approach to innovation and customer collaboration.
- **2023 onwards – Chatbot initiative.** Rather than replacing the entire legacy stack, Bellini opts to **wrap existing systems with a chatbot interface**. The chatbot provides natural‑language access to CRM, projects, time tracking, employee data and the wiki, making it easier for employees to find information and perform routine actions.

Bellini’s history is characterised by **pragmatic evolution**: careful steps that preserve stability and know‑how while gradually adopting new practices and technologies.
