# Locations & Sites

Bellini Coatings operates from **two main production sites** and several **small sales branches** across Europe.

## Headquarters & Italian Factory

- **Location:** Northern Italy, between Milan and Bergamo (industrial area on the edge of town).
- **Functions hosted:**
  - Executive leadership (Board, CEO, CFO, COO)
  - Central Sales & Key Account Management
  - R&D and Technical Service Laboratories
  - Finance & Controlling
  - Human Resources
  - IT & Digital

**Key characteristics:**

## Serbian Factory

- **Location:** Industrial zone near a mid‑sized city in northern Serbia (Novi Sad).
- **Functions hosted:**
  - Production and filling of standard and medium‑complexity formulations
  - Regional warehousing and distribution for Central & Eastern Europe

- **Rationale:**
  - More competitive labour and energy costs.
  - Closer to growing markets in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

The Serbian site has a **younger workforce** on average and slightly more modern infrastructure in parts of the plant, but most business systems are still accessed through the same central Progress environment.

## Remote and hybrid work

While production and lab roles are site‑bound, many roles in sales, IT, finance and HR have **hybrid arrangements**, combining days on site with home office. Regardless of location, employees are expected to:

- Use the central systems (CRM, project registry, time logging) as the **system of record**.
- Keep their **location field** in the employee registry up to date.
- Log where they spend their time to support fair workload and cost reporting.
