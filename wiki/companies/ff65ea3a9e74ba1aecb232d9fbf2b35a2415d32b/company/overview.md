## How we work with customers

Bellini is not a “catalogue-only” paint vendor. For many key accounts we work through a **project model**:

1. Sales identifies a need or opportunity.
2. A **project** is opened in the project registry and linked to the customer in the CRM.
3. R&D develops or adapts a formulation.
4. Application specialists run lab and field trials.
5. Once approved, the solution moves into ongoing supply with technical support.

This project-centric way of working is deeply integrated with our internal systems (CRM, project registry, time tracking) and reflects how we think about value: **long‑term partnerships built around tailored solutions.**

## Strategic focus

Over the next decade, Bellini aims to:

- Deepen relationships with **key OEMs** and strategic industrial customers.
- Expand our presence in **Central and Eastern Europe** using the Serbian plant as a cost-effective base.
- Modernise how we use data and systems, while **preserving the reliability** of our legacy Progress OpenEdge backbone.
- Support more **sustainable and lower‑VOC formulations** in line with regulation and customer demand.
