These department names are used consistently in the **employee registry**, time tracking and other systems.

## Reporting relationships

Every employee in the employee registry has a single **direct manager** recorded via the `reports_to` field (internally stored as an employee ID). This supports:

- Organisational charts and headcount analysis.
- Approvals for travel, training and salary changes.
- Reporting lines used by the chatbot when answering “who does X report to?” type questions.

**Team leads and supervisors** (e.g. lab team leaders, production supervisors, regional sales managers) are responsible for:

- Ensuring that **projects** in their area have clear owners.
- Checking that **time tracking** for their team is complete and reasonable.
- Encouraging team members to keep their **skills and wills** profiles updated.

The hierarchy is respected, but day‑to‑day collaboration is informal and often cross‑functional, especially between **Sales, R&D and Operations** on customer projects.
