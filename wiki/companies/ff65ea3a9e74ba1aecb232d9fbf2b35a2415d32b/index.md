# Bellini Coatings – Internal Wiki

Welcome to the internal knowledge base for **Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.** (“**Bellini Coatings**”).  
This wiki is the primary reference for how we work as a company: who we are, what we make, how we are organised, and how to use our internal systems.

The wiki is aimed at **all employees** – from production operators and lab chemists to salespeople and managers. It is also the main source of context for our **internal chatbot**, which reads and searches these pages.
